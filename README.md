## Introduction 
PythonPerfect is a Flask based web application designed to teach users the basics of the Python programming language. The website encourages users to learn the programming basics through the content page and assess their knowledge through the related quiz. Each quiz is based off content related to a specific course. 

Users are able to attempt multiple courses at the same time. Their progress is tracked and is viewable in the content page. Should the user be granted administrative priveleges, they will gain the ability to create new courses for others to attempt.

## Assessment Mechanism
Once a course is selected, an option will be available to attempt the quiz. User responses are saved as they progress through the quiz. Once the quiz is completed, the user's results will be stored and displayed in their profile page 

## App Architecture (Flask)
This application has been constructed using the python Flask micro-framework MVC. In terms of the Model View Controller Architecture, in our application, the model is represented by the SQLite database and SQLAlchemy, the View is represented by the server-side rendering template of jinja2 which assembles the HTML static content based on the request and the Controller is represented by the Python Flask library.

## App Launching
To launch the application on your personal device it is recommended that you use a virtual environment. Python and virtualenv will need to be installed on your system. A detailed guide is provided below:

## Linux OS
#### Install Virtual Environment
```shell
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```
#### Activate Virtual Enviroment
```shell
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```
#### Install required python packages
```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
##### Configuring Flask
```shell
$ export FLASK_APP=PythonPerfect.py
```
#### Run Flask app
```shell
$ flask run
```

## On windows
#### Install Virtual Environment
```shell
>>> pip install virtualenv
```
#### Activate Virtual Enviroment
```shell
>>> python -m venv env
>>> ./env/Scripts/activate
```
#### Install required python packages
```shell
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### Configuring Flask
```shell
>>> set FLASK_APP=PythonPerfect.py
```
#### Run Flask app
```shell
>>> flask run
```

## Setting Flask Environment and Debug/Testing modes
It is highly recommended to avoid setting flask environments by code
i.e. in config.py

Debug mode is by defult enabled when flask environment is set to development
#### Changing Flask Environments:
##### On windows
```shell
$ set FLASK_ENV=<environment>
```
##### On mac/linux
```shell
$ export FLASK_ENV=<environment>
```  
?! CHECK THIS ON LINUX/MAC SYSTEM

## Initialise SQLite database with flask-migrate

**If working on code with changes to schemas**

```shell
$ flask db current
$ flask db heads
```

If current is empty, or different from head

```shell
$ flask db stamp head
```

This will set the current revision in the database to the head,
without performing any changes. 

Instructions on migration repository initialisation omitted
#### Modifying databases
Create new migration script, then update to latest.

```shell
$ flask db migrate
$ flask db upgrade 
```


**For large changes, please inspect the script first before pushing to git**

## Testing Users database
Flask shell context set in `PythonPerfect.py` add imports as required.

#### First start up flask shell

```shell
$ flask shell
```

#### To create new user instance and add it to the database

	>>> u = User(username='testName', email='testEmail@example.com')
	>>> u.set_password('testPassword')
	>>> db.session.add(u)
	>>> db.session.commit()

**IMPORTANT: remember to commit to session, otherwise changes will not be added to the database**

#### To remove test users from database

There are several ways to delete test users from database.

##### By filtering with know infomation, e.g. username

	>>> db.session.delete(User.query.filter_by(username='testName').first())
	>>> db.session.commit()

##### If only test users exist, run loop to delete all

```shell
>>> users = User.query.all()
>>> for u in users:
. . .   db.session.delete(u)
. . .
>>> db.session.commit()
```


## App Testing
Testers for all controllers were made and run in the test.py file. Upon running this script the various testers will run on the applications controllers.

## Design Process

#### Page Design
Front end development was based off mock pages designed in Figma. 

## Database Design
The database is designed such that:
- A user can be either an admin or a normal user.
- Admins have the ability to create content and quizes.
- Each course can have multiple content items
- Each content has an assosciated quiz

The following diagram outlines the database structure:
